#Reflection on GPS 1.1

Prior to the GPS session, I was still struggling a bit with the terminology of git - while I was starting to get more comfortable with the workflow, I probably still didn't understand it well enough to explain it clearly to another person. I specifically didn't really understand "fetch and merge," and was not exactly clear on the process of pull requests with another person (as I had only done them myself)

The session definitely gave me some good practice using fetch and merge - I now feel that I understand what is actually happening with these commands. If I understand correctly, "fetch" is downloading changes from your remote repository to your local repository, and "merge" then simply merges (or would "overwrites" be a correct word here?) one local branch with another.

I asked my pair and guide for help remembering certain commands (git branch -d is one that I've had difficulty remembering), and our guide specifically gave us clarification on what exactly it means to "commit" a file or directory. She used the example of a checkpoint in a videogame - this comparison had been made before in our previous week's work, but hearing it again from a real person helped reinforce it.

I wouldn't say that I find any particular aspect of git to be confusing - rather, I feel I just need more practice using it, and the workflow will become more natural. Overall, I thought the GPS experience was great - I felt a bit awkward at first, but my pair and guide were both very good communicators, and easy to work with. Next time I will try not to interrupt my pair so much, as at times I forgot that we were in designated "driver" and "navigator" roles.
